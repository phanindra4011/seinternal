Detailed description of each feature (e.g., patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing)

Functional requirements (what the system must do)

External Interface Requirements:

User interface requirements (how users will interact with the system)

Hardware interface (if applicable)

Software interface (integration with third-party systems, e.g., payment gateways)

System Attributes:

Performance (response times, system load handling)

Any external dependencies (third-party libraries or services)

Example of SRS for Appointment Scheduling Feature

1. Feature Name: Appointment Scheduling
2. Functional Requirement:

The system must allow patients to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments.

Patients should be able to see the available time slots for specific doctors.

The system should notify patients and doctors of upcoming appointments.

Doctors must have the option to block certain time slots for personal reasons or breaks.

3. Non-Functional Requirement:

The system should provide a 95% uptime for appointment booking availability.

Notifications should be sent via email or SMS within 10 minutes of scheduling or changes.

Does that help clarify the SRS and CMS for you? Would you like more details on how to write a specific part of the SRS, or maybe dive deeper into CMS features?
